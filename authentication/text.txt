stateful--> and Stateless

Types of Authentication
âœ… Common Methods:
| Type                  | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic Auth**        | Uses `username:password` in HTTP headers    |
| **Session-based**     | Server stores user sessions using cookies   |
| **Token-based (JWT)** | User gets a token after login; used in APIs |
| **OAuth 2.0**         | Login via Google/Facebook/GitHub            |
| **Biometric**         | Face, fingerprint (used in mobile apps)     |

How JWT Authentication Works (Standard for APIs)
JWT (JSON Web Token) is most common for REST APIs.

ðŸ“Œ Workflow:
User logs in (POST /login)

Server verifies credentials

Server issues a signed token (JWT)

Client stores token (e.g., in localStorage)

Client sends token in Authorization header for protected requests

Server verifies token before granting access

What is JWT?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe way to represent claims securely between two parties.

ðŸ‘‰ It is a stateless authentication system, meaning the server doesnâ€™t need to store session info â€” all info is in the token itself.

jwt 3 parts
Header.Payload.Signature

eg eyJhbGciOi... (Header)
.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0... (Payload)
.h6JN73ahP0T... (Signature)
